Understanding and addressing user needs is a fundamental part of computer science and software development. To interpret user needs effectively, I engage in active communication with stakeholders and use techniques such as interviews, surveys, and observations to understand their goals and pain points. Once these needs are identified, I translate them into specific program requirements. This is where creating “user stories” becomes invaluable. User stories provide a concise, clear description of what the user wants to achieve, written from their perspective. For example, "As a user, I want to receive a notification when my appointment is near, so I don’t miss it." By focusing on the user’s goals and context, user stories help ensure that the program's features align with their expectations.

When developing programs, I follow a structured approach that balances planning, execution, and iteration. Agile processes play a significant role in my development methodology. For example, I aim to incorporate Scrum or Kanban into my work, as these frameworks emphasize collaboration, iterative progress, and flexibility. By breaking projects into sprints or tasks, I can deliver incremental improvements and adapt to feedback effectively. Regular stand-up meetings and sprint reviews ensure that the team stays aligned and any blockers are addressed promptly. Agile’s focus on continuous delivery and customer feedback resonates with my goal of creating user-centered solutions.

Being a good team member in software development goes beyond technical skills; it requires strong communication, collaboration, and adaptability. Good team members actively contribute to discussions, respect diverse perspectives, and prioritize the team's success over individual achievement. They provide constructive feedback, meet deadlines, and are open to receiving suggestions for improvement. Additionally, empathy is key—understanding the challenges faced by others and offering support when needed fosters a positive and productive work environment. In an Agile setting, this also means contributing to shared goals during each sprint and being transparent about progress and challenges. By cultivating these traits, I strive to be an asset to any team I join in the software development field.
